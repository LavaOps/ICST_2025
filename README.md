The **data** directory includes the set of metamorphic relations (Metamorphic Relations.csv) and the pass/fail rate by metamorphic relation (pass_fail by MR.csv). We also include a sample of the concrete data. Full data will be provided upon publication. 


The **boxplot** directory contains the data necessary to reproduce the boxplots in the paper. The data is split into subdirectories representing the different ways of looking at the data (by tool, by model, by type).


The **graphs** directory contains the data to reproduce the graphs in the paper.
